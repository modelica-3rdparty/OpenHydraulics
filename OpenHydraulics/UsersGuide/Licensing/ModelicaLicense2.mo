<p>
<h4>4. Designation of Derivative Works and of Modified Works</h4>

<p>
The identifying designation of Derivative Work and of Modified Work must be different to the corresponding identifying designation of the Original Work.

<p>Licensor agrees to provide You with a copy of the Source Code of the Original Work but reserves the right to decide freely on the manner of how the Original Work is provided. For the matter of clarity, Licensor might provide only a binary representation of the Original Work. In that case, You may (a) either reproduce the Source Code from the binary representation if this is possible (e.g., by performing a copy of an encrypted Modelica package, if encryption allows the copy operation) or (b) request the Source Code from the Licensor who will provide it to You.

You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

<p>
<h4>11. Termination</h4>
